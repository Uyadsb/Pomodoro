# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer application to boost your productivity using the Pomodoro Technique.

## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## Features
